# Project List
This section contains source code and usage instructions for some of our projects that we have built for our platforms related to planning, mapping, state estimation, etc. Feel free to try them out, or raise pull requests for new features ! Be careful while re-configuring them for your platforms.

## MAVROS2

A light-weight python client to interface a quadrotor running the PX4 AutoPilot and connected to Linux based companion computer. This project makes interfacing the quad easier with abstracting typical MAVROS commands.

## VINS_OctoMap

A real-time outdoor mapping method that combines multi-sensor data and registers a 3D Octomap using VINS (Visual-Inertial Navigation System) based state estimate.
